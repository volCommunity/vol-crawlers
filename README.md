# Vol::crawlers

_**We've merged with [Collaborate](https://letscollaborate.co.nz), part of the codebase will be merged but this code is currently no longer under development nor maintained.**_

Welcome! This project is in very early and experimental stage, and help in the following areas would be greatly appreciated!
 
This repository contains the crawlers used to find volunteering gigs.
 
How you could help:
* **Non technical:** Add support for new countries by raising an issue to support your country, and include sites that you would like to be included
* **Technical:** Help writing new or extending current crawlers 

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on contributing to the vol.community crawlers.
